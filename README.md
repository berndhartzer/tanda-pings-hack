# Tanda pings challenge

This is a solution to [Tanda's pings challenge](https://github.com/TandaHQ/work-samples/tree/master/pings%20(backend) using [HHVM](https://hhvm.com/), [Hack](http://hacklang.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and other technologies here ~~~.

I took the opportunity while creating my solution to use HHVM, Hack and SQLite because I hadn't used any of them before. The HHVM/Hack ecosystem has always intrigued me as I spend a lot of time writing PHP. I was interested to see how much of my PHP knowledge was transferable to Hack and what kind of performance impact it would have.

hard to find info on hack, kept bouncing between same few repos and docs, seemed like a lot of implied knowledge etc. here
